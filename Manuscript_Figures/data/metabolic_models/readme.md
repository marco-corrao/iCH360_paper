Other metabolic models used to generate model comparison figures
#### `./iml1515`
*i*ML1515, the parent genome-scale model of *i*CH360 [1]
#### `./ecoli_core`
The *E. coli* core model (ECC) [2]
#### `./ecc2`
The *E. coli* core model 2 (ECC2), from [3]. For a fair comparison with*i*CH360 some identifiers for the exchange reactions had to be modified (`./ecc2/ecc2_standardized.xml`), but the network structure was not affected.
