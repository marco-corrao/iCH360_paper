This folder contains all the code required to produce all figures in the paper (with the exception of the metabolic maps, which were generated via the Escher [1] web-interface).

#### `./notebooks`
A mixture of jupyter (.ipynb) and R markdown (.rmd) notebook, each relevant to a specific figure in the paper
#### `./figures`
output path for the produced figures
#### `./data`
Contains other metabolic models used to produced some figures, namely *E.coli* Core (ECC) [2], *E.coli* Core 2 (ECC2) [3], *i*ML1515 [3]
